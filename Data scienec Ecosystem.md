#Exercise 2: Create markdown cell with title of the notebook using H1 style heading.

# Data Science Ecosystem


#Exercise 3 - Create a markdown cell for an introduction

# In this notebook Data Scienece Tools and Ecosystem are summerized.

Introductory sentence about the Notebook is summarized in a Jupyter Notebook. This notebook is a browser-based application that allows scientist to create and share documents containing code, equations, visualizations, narrative text links, and more. It is like a scientist’s lab notebook,where a scientist records all steps to perform their experiments and the results they can reproduce.In the same way, a Jupyter Notebook allows a Data Scientist to record their data experiments and results that others can reuse, allows data scientist to combine descriptive text, code blocks,and code output in a single file.When a the code is run, it generates output, including plots and tables, within the notebook file. And you can then export the notebook to a PDF orHTML file format that can then be shared with anyone.

Jupyter Lab is a browser-based application that allows you to access multiple Jupyter Notebook files, other code, and data files. In addition, it extends the functionalities of Jupyter Notebooks by enabling you to work with multiple notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.It is compatible with several file formats like CSV, JSON, PDF, Vega, and so on. And it is also an open source. Jupyter Notebooks can be used with cloud-based services like IBM and Google Colab.

They don't require any installation on your local machine. They give you access to the Jupyter Notebook environment and allow you to import and export notebooks using the standard IPython Notebook file format.Also, these services support the Python language and other languages as well. Jupyter Notebooks can be installed via the command line using thepip install function.It can also be downloaded locally on your laptop through the Anaconda Platform from Anaconda dot com. Anaconda is one of the popular distributions which includes Jupyter and Jupyterlab.

#Exercise 4 - Create a markdown cell to list data science languages.Create an ordered list

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

1. **Python:** 
2. **R:** 
3. **SQL:** 
4. **Julia:** 

Python: Widely regarded as the go-to language for data science, Python has extensive libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, making it
versatile for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.
    
R is specifically designed for statistical computing and data analysis. It has a rich ecosystem of packages like ggplot2 for data visualization 
and dplyr for data manipulation.
         
SQL:While not a traditional programming language, SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for working with relational databases, querying and 
extracting data for analysis.

Julia: Julia is gaining popularity in the data science community for its performance advantages. It is designed to be fast and efficient,
making it suitable for numerical and scientific computing.


#Exercise 5 - Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries,add an ordered list.

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

1. **NumPy:**
2. **Pandas:**
3. **Matplotlib:**
4. **Seaborn:**
5. **Scikit-learn:**

1. NumPy: A powerful library for numerical operations and handling multi-dimensional arrays.

2. Pandas: Provides data structures like DataFrame for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

3. Matplotlib: A widely-used library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

4. Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn offers an enhanced interface for statistical data visualization.

5. Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling.



#Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools.
#Create a single column table in this cell with the first row containing the header.

### Data Science Tools

| Data Science Tools           |
| ---------------------------- |
| Jupyter Notebook             |
| RStudio                      |
| VS Code with Python extension|



#Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples.
#Add a line in this cell with H3 style heading with text like: Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

#Arithmetic Expressions Examples

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

 **Addition:**
   result = 5 + 3
   print(result)

**subtraction**
result = 10 - 4
print(result)  

**Multiplication**
result = 5 * 6
print(result)

** Division**
result = 5 / 4
print(result)


```python
#Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers
#  This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
```

```python
#Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours
#converts 200 minutes into hours.
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60

# Print the result in hours
print(200 /60 )
```
